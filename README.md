<h1>Switched Sadness Therapy</h1>
<h2>What is the project about?</h2>
<p>The project is about an idea i had to begin a therapy service during my time in college. I always wanted to work in some form of therapy, because i love the idea of helping people and i have suffered with depression aswell so can relate.</p>
<h2>The Website</h2>
<p>The HTML and CSS was relatively easy to write, with a few problems here and there. However, the Python was incredibly difficult to impliment but i managed to do it. </p>

<p>The Website came together really well, and is probably my favorite part.</p>
<h2>Colors</h2>

<p>When it came to choosing colors for the website, i wanted professional but welcoming. The blue was a gentle choice that contrasted with the grey really nicely so i decided to make it a gradient. The green became the active color because it looked melded with the blue really nicely.</p>
